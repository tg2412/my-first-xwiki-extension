# Create your own XWiki extension.

## NOTE: This is a work in progress, it currently doesn't work properly.

1. Log in to your XWiki installation and open the Administration Interface.
2. Install this extension with the XWiki Extension Manager.
3. Open the page *MyCompany.MyFirstExtension* on your wiki which is installed as part of the extension.

This extension will guide you through the process of making and publishing an XWiki Extension of your own.
Once you have published your first XWiki Extension, anybody can install your extension using the XWiki Extension Manager.
