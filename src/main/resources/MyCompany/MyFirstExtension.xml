<content>Congratulations on installing My First Extension!
You can use this page as a tutorial to help you build extensions of your own and get them published
so users can install them using the XWiki Extension Manager.

= Step 1 - Make your XWiki Application =
Your application can be as simple as a few wiki pages or as complex as multiple core components including external **.jar** libraries. When you're done you will probably have a few XWiki pages which provide the user interface for your application.

= Step 2 - Get the repository =
Clone the [[git repository located here&gt;&gt;http://purl.org/xwiki/contrib/my-first-xwiki-extension]]. Notice the file ##src/main/resources/MyCompany/MyFirstExtension.xml## this is the exported form of this page here.

= Step 3 - Export your application =
For each page which makes up your application, use the //export as xar// feature as shown below to get the **.xar** file.
After downloading the **.xar** file, rename that file, changing the extension to **.zip**. Then open it using a zip file handling utility on your system. Inside you will find a directory (folder) named after the //Space// where your document was located, copy this directory into the ##src/main/resources## directory in the //my-first-extension// git repository.

= Step 4 - Declare your dependencies =
If your application contains XWiki components and/or third party libraries, declare dependencies on them in the ##pom.xml## file just as any other Maven dependency.

= Step 5 - Verify that your extension builds =
To check that the ##pom.xml## file was properly crafted and the XML files are okay, run ##mvn clean install## in the repository directory. You may see errors from the exported XML files such as follows:

{{code language=none}}
[INFO] --- xwiki-commons-tool-xar-plugin:4.4-SNAPSHOT:verify (default-verify) @ my-first-xwiki-extension ---
[INFO] Checking validity of XAR XML files...
[INFO]   Verifying [MyCompany/MyFirstExtension.xml]... errors
[INFO]   - Author must be [xwiki:XWiki.Admin] but was [XWiki.Admin]
[INFO]   - Content Author must be [xwiki:XWiki.Admin] but was [XWiki.Admin]

[INFO]   - Parent must not be empty
[INFO]   - Version must be [1.1] but was [4.3]
[INFO]   - Default Language must be empty but was [en]
{{/code}}

This is caused by XWiki export failing to produce a canonical XML file, you must edit the XML files manually to correct the problems.
